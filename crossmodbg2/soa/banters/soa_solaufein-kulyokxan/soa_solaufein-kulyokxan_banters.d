~Solaufein, I need to speak to you in private. Will you oblige me?~
DO ~SetGlobal("G#XB.SolaufeinXanBanter1","GLOBAL",2)~
== BSOLA ~It seems that I cannot refuse this offer.~
== BO#XAN ~(sigh) And you are right. Let us come aside, here. Listen...~
== BO#XAN ~You have gone against an entire drow city. This requires uncanny courage. But marching to a certain death may take courage neither you nor I possess.~
== BSOLA ~You speak of Irenicus, do you not?~
== BO#XAN ~No. I speak of another enemy we are about to face. His sister. And I may not survive this meeting.~
== BO#XAN ~Perhaps you will. Perhaps you will get out of Bodhi's lair alive - who knows? But don't you dare abandon <CHARNAME>. Betray her, and I will find you from beyond the grave. Is this clear?~
== BSOLA ~I know well the price I have to pay for walking under these skies, Xan. And I know who brought me here. But allow me to ask you a question in turn. Do you think me capable of betrayal, because you doubt yourself?~
== BO#XAN ~I do. A part of me wants to run away. Another part of me squirms and whines and wants me to grab <CHARNAME>'s hand and disappear into the blue, regardless of her wishes. I do not know why I am telling you this: because I feel death approaching? (sigh) Rather, because this is all irrelevant: I may think whatever I like, but I will go forward, regardless.~
== BSOLA ~Then we are alike in this. Naught else needs be said.~
== BO#XAN ~You think so?~
== BSOLA ~When I knew Phaere ordered me killed, I wanted to enter her chambers, shake her and force her to look into my eyes, to become Phaere I once knew. Another part of me wanted her dead.~
== BSOLA ~But I did neither. I waited, and watched, and prepared a second set of silver dragon's eggs. My indifference became a weapon. My mind paid no attention to the bleeding heart. And I survived.~
== BO#XAN ~We are alike then. How strange.~
== BSOLA ~Let us hope it is our strength, then, and not our weakness.~
