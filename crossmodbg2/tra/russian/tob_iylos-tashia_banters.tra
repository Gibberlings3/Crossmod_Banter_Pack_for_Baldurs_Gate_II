@0    = ~Iylos, what is it with you and <CHARNAME>? Did you know - and dislike - <PRO_HIMHER> previous to meeting in Saradush, or is the enmity you display towards <PRO_HIMHER> a product of delusion?~
@1    = ~Delusion?! <CHARNAME> is a Bhaalspawn, Tashia, a product of evil! My dislike of <PRO_HIMHER> is founded upon-~
@2    = ~Your dislike of <PRO_HIMHER> is founded upon nothing, Iylos. Zilch. And you know it. So why continue to dislike <PRO_HIMHER>?~
@3    = ~<CHARNAME> is a Bhaalspawn. I need no other reason.~
@4    = ~I think there's something more that you're not telling me, but I won't pressure you now. Another time, maybe.~
@5    = ~I can hardly wait.~
@6    = ~Tashia, what is that scroll you're holding?~
@7    = ~Oh, it's just a little something I picked up in the last town we were in. A fireball, if you must know.~
@8    = ~Why do you study it so intently? Do you not simply have to read out the words, and the magic is cast?~
@9    = ~It's a little more complicated than that, Iylos. I have to understand the forces *behind* the spell, as well as the verbal component - and there is a somatic component as well. I mean, there are movements involved.~
@10   = ~And here I was thinking you simply felt like an impromptu jig of success each time you cast a spell.~
@11   = ~There's also the intonations to consider. Did you know, that if you mispronounce a word of a spell, you might, instead of getting a Fireball roasting your enemies like steaks, get a cow falling on your head?~
@12   = ~...I must admit, I had not considered that. Must you truly be that precise?~
@13   = ~Yes. Magic is incredibly powerful-~
@14   = ~I know.~
@15   = ~And it is also wont to do what *it* wants, rather than what *you* want. That is the essence of wild magic, of course - but my magic comes from deep within me, and that is another type of magic which is entirely different. It involves a lot more concentration and effort, lest I let the magic spill over and do something I don't want it to.~
@16   = ~So, I hope now you have a better idea of why I study spells so seriously, Iylos.~
@17   = ~Yes. Thank you for that enlightening lesson, Tashia. I do appreciate it.~
@18   = ~No problem at all, Iylos - any time.~
