@0    = ~I'll drink to that.~
@1    = ~Well, they've certainly made fools out of us.  Usually slavers don't know how to do more than crack a whip.  Yet, here we are, one companion short and without a single clue to follow.~
@2    = ~Although if you ask me, the Copper Coronet would perhaps be a good place to start.  There are always these suspicious fellows hanging around there, buying a girl a drink and trying to lure them into a dark alleyway.  I've seen many fall into that ruse and never come back.~
@3    = ~It might get us nowhere, but they must have a mayor or something.  He might be able to point us in the right direction.~
