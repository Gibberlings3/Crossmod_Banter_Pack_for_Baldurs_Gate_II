@0    = ~Gods, Afu, what on Nine Hells are you eating?~
@1    = ~A roasted beetle in saffron! Afu isn't sure you know, but saffron is a really expensive spice!~
@2    = ~I know that, but still... it's a strange combination.~
@3    = ~You know, once Afu couldn't afford such snacks, but now Afu can! And that's why Afu wants to try all the expensive food. Even if it's quite "bleh". But this is... okay.~
@4    = ~Uhm... good for you. I guess.~
