// Montaron - Tiax
@663 = ~Hey gnome, you muttered in your sleep again last night! I can't sleep because of you! Do it again and you'll regret it!~
@664 = ~You dare threaten the great Tiax, rogue? If Tiax wants to, he will trample you like an insect! Your very birth was only possible because Tiax decided so!~
@665 = ~You idiot! When I was born, you didn't even exist yet! How could you have possibly decided anything?~
@666 = ~The will of the great Tiax is not limited to the pitiful hours and years with which you measure your lives! He can command both the past and the future! The wheel of time only turns because Cyric decided so! ~
@667 = ~Is that so? So if I were to punch you in the nose right now, would Cyric help you? Would he smite me with lightning or what?~
@668 = ~You... you... blasphemer! Bow to Tiax's will or you will regret it!~
@669 = ~My only regret is that I am traveling with a useless fool like you! You're not even fit for the role of a foolish jester!~
