@1    = ~And what specific habit do you have in mind, Foundling? The one to avoid your presence, dark fellow?~
@2    = ~Dedicating yourself to pleasures. You get your guard down every time you seek a companion among women. Somehow I believe it would be easy for a female assassin to end this life of yours.~

@4    = ~Surely better than a death on the battlefield. (grin)~
