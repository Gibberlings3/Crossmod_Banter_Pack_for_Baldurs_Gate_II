@13   = ~I have something for you, Ninde. Here. It's some perfume I believe you may like.~
@14   = ~You're dealing with some dead things and... other weird stuff. I suppose you may be fed up with smell of dead creatures and burnt bones.~
@15   = ~Pumpkin, you really should not try so hard. It's quite unbecoming.~
@16   = ~I like you and I thought I should do something nice and I thought of this. I know I may sometimes make faces when you do your necro-things and I was kinda afraid you could get a wrong idea that I don't like you or something.~
@17   = ~How precious you are, worrying about such silly things. But... hmm. This perfume is of *quite* high quality--I'm almost impressed. I would not have guessed that you were so discerning.~
@18   = ~So you like it? Well, of course you do. Anyway, use it well. I think it suits you, Ninde.~
@19   = ~Ohh, I think it suits me as well, though most perfumes do, really. Still... it was quite a clever little gift. Thank you, sweet thing.~
