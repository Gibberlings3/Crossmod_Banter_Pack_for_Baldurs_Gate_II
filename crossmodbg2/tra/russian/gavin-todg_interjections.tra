@0    = ~More riddles. The last one almost did me in. I would have said 'wind.'~
@1    = ~Tragic, that poverty would drive a man to such desperate acts.~
@2    = ~Colors hold some strange mystical significance for these people, if the loss of a skein of yarn could distress that man so. It's almost as if it's the stuff of life for them.~
@3    = ~Now there's a battle I don't want to repeat. I thought we were done, for sure. Praise Lathander, we survived it, and we have what we came for.~
@4    = ~That's nine. Which makes us almost done, thank Lathander. I won't forget this place in a hurry, but I'll be glad to feel the sun on my face again.~
@5    = ~Why did you send me away just now, <CHARNAME>? Is everything all right?~
@6    = ~It was nothing, Gavin. Just a few words passed between us, nothing more.~
@7    = ~He tried to seduce me, but I resisted.~
@8    = ~She tried to seduce me, but I resisted.~
@9    = ~It went a little farther than I wanted it to go, but we needed that Color to get out of here. You do understand, don't you?~
@10   = ~It was... exhilarating! He traced patterns of the Color on my skin, and on his, and we became joined, somehow. It was like we shared our emotions.~
@11   = ~It was... exhilarating! She traced patterns of the Color on my skin, and on hers, and we became joined, somehow. It was like we shared our emotions.~
@12   = ~Ah.~
@13   = ~That's a relief. I know you can take care of yourself, but for all that some of these people seem to be friendly, others can turn violent in a heartbeat.~
@14   = ~Well, that's good. Not that I'm trying to tell you what to do, but after meeting Red, Yellow, and some of the others, I'm not sure we can trust these people.~
@15   = ~That's a relief. Not that I don't trust you, love, but after meeting Red, Yellow and some of the others, I'm not sure we can trust them.~
@16   = ~You mean... did he... ?~
@17   = ~No, Gavin, he didn't touch me, but I was still uncomfortable.~
@18   = ~He didn't force me to lie with him, but he had his hands places I didn't want them to be.~
@19   = ~Please don't make me talk about it, Gavin.~
@20   = ~You mean... did she... ?~
@21   = ~No, Gavin, she didn't touch me, but I was still uncomfortable.~
@22   = ~She didn't force me to lie with her, but she had her hands places I didn't want them to be.~
@23   = ~Well, that certainly gives me something to think about... probably in more detail than my composure can endure.~
@24   = ~You let him touch you... and it thrilled you. Ilmater's mercy, I did not want to hear that.~
@25   = ~I was making the best of  bad situation, Gavin. He had the last Color, and we need that to get out of here. I might have preferred not to go that far, but since it was that or be trapped here, I tried to at least enjoy it.~
@26   = ~I really don't know what came over me. Ordinarily, I never would have dreamed of being unfaithful, but the intensity of it swept me away.~
@27   = ~It was like nothing I've ever felt before. The sensuous emotion of it... I've still got goosebumps, just thinking about it.~
@28   = ~Think of the place we're in, Gavin, and the people we've met here. I knew I'd never have another chance at an experience like that, and I hoped you would understand. I still love you, and I still want to be with you, but I had to try it just once.~
@29   = ~You let her touch you... and it thrilled you. Ilmater's mercy, I did not want to hear that.~
@30   = ~I was making the best of  bad situation, Gavin. She had the last Color, and we need that to get out of here. I might have preferred not to go that far, but since it was that or be trapped here, I tried to at least enjoy it.~
@31   = ~I can only imagine. I'm sorry you had to go through that, but at least you were able to get away before it got out of hand.~
@32   = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I'm sorry you had to go through that. If only I'd known... ~
@33   = ~Are you going to be alright?~
@34   = ~I think so.~
@35   = ~In time, maybe. I'm still in shock.~
@36   = ~I'll live.~
@37   = ~Hold me... please.~
@38   = ~Alright, then, I won't make you, but I can't wait to put this place behind us, for your sake.~
@39   = ~(sigh) Well, I guess that's the practical way of looking at it, though I am disappointed.~
@40   = ~I had no idea you were so easily carried away by your emotion. But come on, we've still got to get out of here.~
@41   = ~Wonderful. And how am I supposed to compete with that? Goosebumps...~
@42   = ~That does wonders for my pride. I'm sure my efforts pale by comparison. Let's just get this over with.~
@43   = ~I'll try to understand. I really will. But it's hard.~
@44   = ~I hoped the closeness we share when we make love was more than just another 'experience' to you... but I will try to understand. I really will.~
@45   = ~Alright, if you're sure... I'm still sorry that you had to endure it.~
@46   = ~Perfectly understandable. I'm just sorry you had to go through that.~
@47   = ~(Gavin's arms encircle you gently, but he lets you move closer to him rather than drawing you closer. He holds you lightly, letting you rest your cheek against his chest, if you wish, then releases you the moment you start to pull away from him.)~
@48   = ~I don't want to rush you, but the sooner we move, the sooner we can be away from here.~
@49   = ~Well, if you've taken no permanent harm, we should get moving.~
@50   = ~If you're ready, we should go.~
