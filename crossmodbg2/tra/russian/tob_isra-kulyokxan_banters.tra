@0    = ~Something tells me that <CHARNAME> won't be a very successful <PRO_LADYLORD> of Murder.~ [O#XAN000]
@1    = ~<CHARNAME> has a good heart. You know this as well as I do. No matter what happens, <PRO_HESHE> will never take Bhaal's place.~
@2    = ~Won't <PRO_HESHE>? Yes, <CHARNAME> is charming, and loyal, and a great listener. One of the best friends and companions I have ever had... my only true friend, perhaps.~
@3    = ~But <CHARNAME> is also a divine being who makes choices behind closed doors, when it is just <PRO_HIMHER> and Solar - and we mercifully lie unconscious. Which questions are asked? Which choices are made? We will only know when the curtain rises and <CHARNAME> takes <PRO_HISHER> father's place. Or not.~
@4    = ~I trust <CHARNAME>, and I trust <PRO_HISHER> heart. And I am surprised at you. Do you not believe in <PRO_HIMHER>?~
@5    = ~It's... not a question of faith, or trust. Not anymore. Alaundo's prophecies are at work. And one <PRO_RACE>, however bright and brave, can't stand against them.~
@6    = ~Or can <PRO_HESHE>?~
@7    = ~Prophecies are seldom written in stone, Xan, and never fully understood until after the fact. I would hesitate to make assumptions so soon.~
