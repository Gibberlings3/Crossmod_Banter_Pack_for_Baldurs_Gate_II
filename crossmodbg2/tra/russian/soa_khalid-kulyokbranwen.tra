@0 = ~It's g-good to know you t-too have experience working for the m-militia, Branwen.~
@1 = ~I do. And I indeed remember you worked for the Calishite militia.~
@2 = ~Hmm, I suppose this kind of training shows one what discipline means. And if you are lucky enough, you'll learn more about teamwork or group effort.~
@3 = ~I'd s-say it's even more than just that. We were friends. Brothers in arms, rather than... "group m-members". We did everything together when we c-could.~
@4 = ~Good for you, then, Khalid. I am sure this experience taught you much. Use it all on the battlefield. Give a good example, so people know it's all worth the effort.~
@5 = ~Hmm, I heard winters are quite c-cold out on the Moonshae Isles. And they m-must be long.~
@6 = ~It's nothing a strong person wouldn't survive. Moonshae Isles can force you to learn the art of survival and that I am grateful for.~
@7 = ~I've m-met some women of s-strong spirit in my life. Jaheira was one of them. You have it, t-too.~
@8 = ~The Realms need women like that. I must admit it's a pity she was killed, Khalid, but at least we all learned something from her. She died a hero, not another drunk aristocrat who knew nothing about the battlefield or strength. She is worth remembering.~
