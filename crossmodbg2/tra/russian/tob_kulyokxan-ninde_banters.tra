@0    = ~Welcome back to the Spirit, Ninde. As any elf, I am happy for you. How are you feeling?~ [O#XAN000]
@1    = ~It is difficult to describe. I am walking into the light, and the light does not diminish. I am a dangerous predator, a tigress with sharpened claws, an archmage...~
@2    = ~... And then you are a little girl again.~
@3    = ~However did you know?~
@4    = ~I feel it each time in communion and reverie. And I've... seen something similar before. In <CHARNAME>'s expression.~
@5    = ~He is a darling, isn't he? Pity about the scrapes with these unwashed siblings of his.~
@6    = ~(sigh) I suppose in your case, the word "soulmates" has a very precise meaning. I wonder what will happen when <CHARNAME> ascends, though. Will you be joined with him as a demigoddess, or be forgotten here on the Prime?~
@7    = ~I am not the one men leave behind, dear. I am an immortal now. As for my would-be ascended lord and lover... we'll see.~
