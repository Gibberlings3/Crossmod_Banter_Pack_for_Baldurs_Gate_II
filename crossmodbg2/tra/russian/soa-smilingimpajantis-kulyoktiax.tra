// Ajantis - Tiax
@686 = ~Hey fancy armor guy! When the hour of Tiax's reign comes, you paladins will keep order in his domain by looking for conspirators and executing them!~ [TIAXX19]
@687 = ~The Order will not serve you. We are called to fight evil, and it takes many forms. Sometimes evil is hidden under the mask of rulers and kings. Therefore, if you become an unworthy ruler, the Order may turn against you.~
@688 = ~You are a fool! Tiax will then put an end to your miserable Order with a wave of his hand! He will trample you like dung beetles and then stand on your lifeless bodies and drink tea from your helms! Hmm, yes, speaking of which... Looks like it's time to brew some herbal tea. Tiax likes tea. Off with you paladin I have tea to make.~ [TIAXX33]
@689 = ~By all means, whatever makes it so I don't have to continue to talk with you gnome.~
