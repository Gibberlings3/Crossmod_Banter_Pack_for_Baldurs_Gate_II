@0  = ~You search for peace and understanding and acceptance is both adorable and foolish, half-orc. You're exactly the type that would fall for Caelar Argent's promises during the crusade.~
@1  = ~You know nothing about what I look for, Hephernaan. And you may think I am foolish, but I'm not. I know my own value and powers...~
@2  = ~Truly? I have a feeling that you're still searching for something. For... a purpose, perhaps?~
@3  = ~Do you think that's what someone aware of his powers and value would do? Search for some purpose for weeks. Perhaps months.~
@4  = ~You may try to poison my mind, Hephernaan, but you won't succeed. Begone.~
@5  = ~Poison? Hah. No. I am just wondering when you're going to realize that you know little about what a true purpose is. But... you're right. I think we have nothing else to tell each other.~
@6  = ~Boredom forces me to ask, half-orc: do you really believe you will find peace? Or is it just this... stupidity you must have inherited after one of your parents?~
@7  = ~You know nothing about my powers and my aims, we have already come to that conclusion, devil. Someone like you can never understand what I long for. You never will, even if you tried.~
