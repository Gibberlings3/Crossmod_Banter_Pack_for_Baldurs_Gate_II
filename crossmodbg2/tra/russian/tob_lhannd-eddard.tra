@0    = ~There are many annoying noblemen in Athkatla, but you would actually be a fine neighbor. Someone I wouldn't mind living next to.~
@1    = ~Well, thank you. I believe we could even organize some... weekly meetings with wine and share who did what and why it might end with another drama.~
@2    = ~Oh, would you invite me to? I hope you would!~
@3    = ~ONLY if you behave, sister.~
@4    = ~That could be fun, wouldn't it?~
@5    = ~Maybe. Depends on how much wine we have, I suppose. And I hope you would also bring something to munch on!~
@6    = ~Hah, of course.~
