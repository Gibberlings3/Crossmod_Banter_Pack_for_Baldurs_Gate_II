@123 = ~You're so different than your sister, Minyae. In fact, some of the last words she said to me was, "You need to be more pessimistic".~
@124 = ~Or, did she say, "I don't like your optimism". I really can't remember.~
@125 = ~Nevermind what my sister said. She says... said a lot of mean things, but I'm sure, she didn't mean them.~
@126 = ~I sure hope not! They were really mean!~
@127 = ~It's alright. She's not here anymore...~
