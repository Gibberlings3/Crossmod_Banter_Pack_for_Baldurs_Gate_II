@1    = ~Ah, that? These are my eyedrops. It's to protect my eyes from dust, hot air, cold air, dry air...~
@2    = ~Yes, I... I see. It's for all sorts of c-conditions that can harm your eyes in... any sort of way, I suppose. You c-clearly take care of your eyes...~
@3    = ~Well, they let me see! How else would I aim my powers and strike our enemies without my eyes?~
@4    = ~Right. S-silly me...~
@5    = ~Gods, there are always s-so many places where people c-could use our help.~
@6    = ~Well, organize some bone dust for me from twenty different dragon horns, and maybe I'll buy us a few hours. Maybe even a day!~
@7    = ~Thank you, Walahnan, b-but I'm afraid we would still need more t-time... and I can't imagine us k-killing so many dragons anyway.~
@8    = ~B-but, with our luck... who knows...~
