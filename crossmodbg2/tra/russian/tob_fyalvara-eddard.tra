@0    = ~I remember my kids being quite loud when they were young. Especially my two oldest sons. They would fight, they would kick each other. I wouldn't be able to count the times I talked to them about it even if I tried!~
@1    = ~Well, I do remember my sister kicking me for not wanting me to try out some silly costume she made for me.~
@2    = ~Hey! It wasn't silly!~
@3    = ~Ah, yes. That is exactly what I am talking about. They would be... pain in the back, I think I can now say it. They would fight, run, break things. Once they even tried to pee on a cat, because they decided they were going to make some... bizarre competition. Gods, I'm so happy the cat was faster than they ever were.~
@4    = ~Oh, that's... not something I even tried.~
@5    = ~Pff. You were much more boring than Fyalvara's boys, I guess. On the other hand... wouldn't that scar the cat for life...?~
@6    = ~My boys could be some like some small... "Bhaalspawns", heh. But they are fine men now. That I must admit.~
