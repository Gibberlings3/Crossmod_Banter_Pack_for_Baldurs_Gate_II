@1    = ~Well, sweet Skie, that's because I remembered you as a specialist when it comes to perfume. And now—now I can no longer smell it on you.~
@2    = ~I don't use them everyday now. They got me into trouble more than once. Eh, I guess goblins can tell when new fragrance by Nakaoto Chidori is out of place. A pity, because I love Kozakuran perfumes and...~
@3    = ~...wait. Was that your nice way of telling me I don't smell nice?~
@4    = ~Oh, sweetie, I never said such a thing. Did I? I said I can't smell perfume on you to<DAYNIGHT>, but I never said I do not like the scent that surrounds you.~
@5    = ~Oh... right. Well... thanks. It's quite nice of you. But somehow I'm still not sure what I should say.~
