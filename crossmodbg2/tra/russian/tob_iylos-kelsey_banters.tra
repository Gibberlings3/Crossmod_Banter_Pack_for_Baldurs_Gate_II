@0    = ~Kelsey, I have to say, you are not what I expected.~
@1    = ~No? What were you expecting then, Iylos?~
@2    = ~From what I had heard, I was expecting either a frighteningly powerful sorcerous mage with magic flowing from his fingertips, or a frightened, weak young man who is not sure of anything at all.~
@3    = ~I'm not sure whether to be offended or not, honestly- but I'm certainly not a frightened, weak young man any longer, but I'm not an archmage with power streaming from his fingers, either.~
@4    = ~You're a very different man than I imagined. You are hesitant, and yet I can sense the power you wield. You tread purposely, but with a hint of caution. You are full of polarities, it seems.~
@5    = ~Since I was little, magical accidents occured around me because I was out of control - I guess I've learned to temper my magic with a little caution, is all.~
@6    = ~Do you use meditation to help control your power, or some other form of ordering the mind?~
@7    = ~A little meditation helps, I've found. Or, at least, clearing my mind and trying to organise it a bit. I learnt that after spending some time adventuring with <CHARNAME>, you become organised or you die, because not being organised is just not an option.~
@8    = ~ An interesting way of looking at it.~
@9    = ~Mmm. I've always thought so.~
@10   = ~Iylos, why do you travel with <CHARNAME> if you're so reluctant to be in <PRO_HISHER> company?~
@11   = ~Duty.~
@12   = ~Is that all? Surely you've come to realise <CHARNAME> isn't bad, and that <PRO_HESHE> is doing so much good for the world?~
@13   = ~No, I have not. I travel because I was asked to by someone I trust, and owe my life to. That is enough.~
@14   = ~Maybe it is, but I find it hard to believe you've stayed so far only because of that.~
@15   = ~Believe what you like, Sorceror, but that is the reason.~
@16   = ~Don't worry, I will - but I wish you would stop giving everyone the cold shoulder, Iylos, it isn't becoming of someone supposedly wiser than everyone else.~
@17   = ~I have, yes. But at the time, it was because I was asked to by someone I trust, and owe my life to. That was enough.~
@18   = ~Maybe it was, but I find it hard to believe you've stayed so far only because of that.~
@19   = ~I stay because it is the right thing to do, to stop the Five. <CHARNAME> perhaps is not as bad as I had originally conceived, but still, I believe <PRO_HESHE> requires watching.~
@20   = ~I don't think <PRO_HESHE> does, but that's up to you, I suppose. Just - don't keep giving everyone the cold shoulder. It isn't becoming of someone supposedly wiser than everyone else.~
@21   = ~I'll try to keep my desire for solitude less obvious, then, Kelsey.~
@22   = ~I think we would *all* appreciate that, Iylos.~
