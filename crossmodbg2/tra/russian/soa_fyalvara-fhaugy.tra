@0    = ~You certainly are a big boy, Fhaugy, and you know how to use these fists of yours. But I hope you're not a tavern brawler.~
@1    = ~No, I don't think I am...? I mean, unless someone decides that they want to mess with me! Hah! But I don't usually spark that kind of stuff.~
@2    = ~Good. That's good to know.~
@3    = ~You see, I asked about how you act in taverns because I'm a proud owner of a teahouse and while there aren't many fights in such places, they still may happen. And that can be quite annoying.~
@4    = ~I still remember the day I had to clean after Blarghind, who decided it was a good idea to throw a pot at a merchant he disliked.~
@5    = ~I obviously made him help me. I'm not the type of woman that would let something like that slide.~
@6    = ~Hah! That's good! I wish I could see how you deal with such men, Fyalvara! It must have been quite a view!~
@7    = ~I, on the other hand, how you won't need me to see me in a similar situation. Not in my own teahouse. Such situations aren't beneficial for anyone.~
