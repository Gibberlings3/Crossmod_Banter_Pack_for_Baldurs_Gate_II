@0    = ~Sometimes I wonder if that's you who got bigger, or is it me who got smaller.~
@1    = ~You do not feel smaller, Fyalvara. Actually, I feel you look even more powerful than when we met!~
@2    = ~Heh, thank you. In my age, however, there are days when one may feel somewhat smaller.~
@3    = ~Do not get me wrong though, boy. I know I can still deal with monsters or the pace itself. But I also know that... there are days I wish that were slower.~
@4    = ~Huh, well, truth to be told, even I have had such days before, so... I guess they're normal? That may have nothing to do with age, my friend.~
@5    = ~Well, that's somehow reassuring.~
