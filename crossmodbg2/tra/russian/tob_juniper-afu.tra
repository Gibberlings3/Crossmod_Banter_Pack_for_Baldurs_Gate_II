@0    = ~Oh, Afu thinks you have some nice jewelry! Nice. Probably expensive. Is it expensive?~
@1    = ~I do not know, I never asked anyone to price it. I mostly found these things, and some of them were gifts.~
@2    = ~Well, Afu wouldn't be surprised if you could get a small fortune for it!~
@3    = ~I am not planning on selling them, Afu.~
@4    = ~Ah. Well... right. But you should know that they do not look like cheap stuff. Keep that in mind.~
