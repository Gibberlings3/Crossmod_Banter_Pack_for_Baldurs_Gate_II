@0    = ~(Sigh.) Do you really think that I haven't noticed your sideways glances at me, Nathaniel? What is it you wish to say to me?~
@1    = ~I'm sorry, Amber. I didn't mean to be rude, it's just that I've never seen anyone--~
@2    = ~--as odd-looking as me?~
@3    = ~As *interesting* looking as you.~
@4    = ~I do appreciate your courteous choice of words, but they still amount to pretty much the same thing. To me being different from everyone else.~
@5    = ~(Sigh.) Everyone's different in some way or another, it's just that with you it's a bit more, well, visible.~
@6    = ~But it is what can be seen that matters. It seems you have rather a lot to learn about being different.~
@7    = ~Amber, are you ever afraid that those earrings of yours could get caught in something?~
@8    = ~What, these? No, I can't really say that I've ever even thought of it. Why?~
@9    = ~I just had the image of you getting caught on a - ha! - caught on a tree, or something, and having to get someone to detach you!~
@10   = ~Well, you sure do have a vivid imagination.~
@11   = ~I'm sorry, I meant no ill with it. The image just popped into my mind from somewhere and I simply couldn't help asking you.~
@12   = ~Well, you could always get a set for yourself to find out how they feel. I'm sure a big man like yourself could take the pain, and it would be only fair to give me an equal chance to see you stuck on a tree, don't you think?~
@13   = ~I take your point.~
@14   = ~Besides, it never hurts to have a little something for the ferryman.~
@15   = ~Hmm? I don't quite--~
@16   = ~For a rainy day.~
@17   = ~Ah. Yes, I know how that is. (Seemingly unconciously, Nathaniel twists the green ring on his finger.)~
@18   = ~Ah. Yes, I know how that is.~
@19   = ~<CHARNAME>, you got a moment? I was just wondering if you've noticed the way Nathaniel's been acting around you lately. It seems to me that he is harbouring very tender feelings for you.~
@20   = ~Yes, I've noticed. I can't say that I don't feel flattered.~
@21   = ~Yes, I've noticed. It's actually getting a bit uncomfortable.~
@22   = ~Now that you mention it, I can see what you mean.~
@23   = ~I can't say that I have noticed anything. Are you sure you are not just imagining it?~
@24   = ~What? You must be out of your mind to imagine something like that.~
@25   = ~I can see why you would feel that. You should not let yourself to be deluded by it, however.~
@26   = ~I can see why you would feel that. I don't think that he means to make you uncomfortable, though.~
@27   = ~I'm glad you do. I think that now that you know, you should consider doing something about it.~
@28   = ~I'm pretty sure that I'm not imagining anything. It's pretty obvious once you admit the possibility.~
@29   = ~You can deny it all you want, but at some point you'll have to face the truth.~
@30   = ~Just try to put yourself in Nathaniel's shoes for a bit. Going through the death of a loved one can be very hard, and it might be that attaching himself to you is his way of coping with it.~
@31   = ~Just ... tread carefully with him, that's all I'm saying.~
@32   = ~Well, I have to admit that I do think of him as more than a friend.~
@33   = ~I don't know what you mean. All I can say that the feeling certainly isn't mutual. I'm with you as you well know.~
@34   = ~This isn't any of your business, Amber. I can do whatever I like.~
@35   = ~Then you'd better make sure that he knows it. He probably hasn't completely realised it, himself.~
@36   = ~Then you shouldn't keep him hanging. People's feelings are not something to be toyed with.~
@37   = ~Of course you can. And so can I.~
@38   = ~In any case, I just thought I should bring it up before someone's feelings get hurt.~
