@0    = ~Why do people address you as "white hand", warrior?  Has it something to do with your skin tone or your origin?~
@1    = ~[ARAN] Well, now, that be th' family name. I never did ask why that were th' case, but mayhap it be on account o' an ancestor bein' a cleric.~
@2    = ~A cleric?  Your people worship many gods... It must have been one of patrons of healing or light.  Otherwise I see no real reason behind your family name.~
@3    = ~Do you like it?  Do you like being called "Whitehand"?~
@4    = ~[ARAN] I like it fine enough. Some folks have th' noble birth an' lineage to hold up a name as a proud one, an' hold it in some kind o' regard. Me, I prefer to judge by th' actions, not th' name, so to speak.~
@5    = ~You're right. But in some cases it might be useful. A few days ago I would say names are pointless, but at that time there were just a few that would speak to me at all. Now it feels as if you and others had more than I do.~
@6    = ~[ARAN] Not havin' even your own name... sounds blighted lonely. No sense o' self, or even whom you can turn to.~
@7    = ~[ARAN] Mayhap you will find one out here what fits you right proper, eh? A name, an' mayhap some sort o' family to back it up.~
@8    = ~No.  I think it's better that way...~
