@225 = ~If there is one thing I dislike, it's gnomes that think they know it all.~
@226 = ~Not all gnomes know it all, actually. In fact, it's very rare that gnomes do know it all, and you're just in luck, because I *am* that very rare gnome with the power of knowing it all!~
@227 = ~Minyae, I noticed you were moving in a very weird and awkward way when casting your spells.~
@228 = ~Who taught you?~
@229 = ~No one taught me. I taught myself.~
@230 = ~Well, now that makes a lot of sense! You see, I am well on my way of mastering sorcery. Who am I kidding? I am probably there already!~
@231 = ~I was going to give you a couple of pointers, seeing as how you've never been properly taught by a master, but--~
@232 =  ~I really have no need for your idiocy.~
@233 = ~You're going to regret it. You could've had an amazing, brilliant, and highly talented wizard as your mentor, but I guess someone with your intelligence couldn't recognize my potential.~
