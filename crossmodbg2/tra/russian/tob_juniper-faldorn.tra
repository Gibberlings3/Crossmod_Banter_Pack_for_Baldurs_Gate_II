@0    = ~You are observant, girl. Some would say you have the eyes of a predator!~
@1    = ~I don't think I would call myself a predator, Faldorn.~
@2    = ~I don't think a wolf knows the word wolf, yet that doesn't change its nature! I think there is a predator inside you, one that likes to hunt. One that is always ready. Prepared for a fight.~
@3    = ~Eh, perhaps. But I'm also ready for other things. For peace, for example. Sometimes I even crave it.~
@4    = ~You may think we are somehow alike. And in some aspects, perhaps we are, but there is also much that makes as damn different, Faldorn. I'm sorry if that disappoints you.~
@5    = ~Hah! It doesn't, girl. Even if you admitted you ARE a predator, we wouldn't be exactly similar. After all, I embraced that part of myself a long time ago.~
