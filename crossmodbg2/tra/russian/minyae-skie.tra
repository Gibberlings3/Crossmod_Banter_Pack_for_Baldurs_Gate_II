@425 = ~You should really do something with your hair. I think putting it in one long fish braid would do wonders for you!~
@426 = ~Why don't you do something with your hands? Oh, I know. Why don't you put your hand in your mouth so you can stop talking?~
@427 = ~Geez, I was only trying to help. No need to be so rude about it.~
@428 = ~I saw you with Eldoth the other day.~
@429 = ~Mind your own business, girl.~
@430 = ~Well, this is my business! Don't you know what that terrible man did to my family and me?~
@431 = ~You were and are a naive girl. You brought that upon yourself.~
@432 = ~How can you say that?! You know what - nevermind. I'm not even going to bother. He's going to screw up your life like he did mine and when you come back with absolutely nothing, I'll say, "I told you so!"~
@433 = ~That will never happen.~
