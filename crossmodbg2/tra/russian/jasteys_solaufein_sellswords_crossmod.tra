@0  = ~[Solaufein]I thought I escaped that poisonous world for good. But apparently, I was wrong.~
@1  = ~[male drow]You have a drow in your party. That is of no consequence. A male, an exile or not, is irrelevant - just another of your companions. Everyone's eyes will be on you, especially those of the Matron Mother.~
@2  = ~[male drow]I also noticed the male. He is irrelevant, anyway.~
