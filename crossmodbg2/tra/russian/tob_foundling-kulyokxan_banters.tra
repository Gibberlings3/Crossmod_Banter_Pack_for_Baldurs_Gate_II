@0    = ~This place we have seen - the city of elves - was it your home?~
@1    = ~No. I'm from Evereska. It's also an "elven city", though. The one we have seen, the one that almost fell, was Suldanessellar.~
@2    = ~Was it much different to this...Evereska?~
@3    = ~Yes.~
@4    = ~In what way?~
@5    = ~In more than one way, Foundling, but I'm not sure if I want to discuss matters of my homeland with a shade like yourself. Even the one that left the Plane of Shadows...for a while, at least.~
@6    = ~Do you consider me a foe, then?~
@7    = ~Not a foe, no. Rather a threat.~
