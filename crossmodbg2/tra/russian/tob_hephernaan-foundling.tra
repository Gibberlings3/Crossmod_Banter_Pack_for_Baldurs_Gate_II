@0   = ~If I were your master, Foundling, I would be proud to see you become better. Perhaps even strong. Significant.~
@1   = ~Luckily for me, you are not my master, Hephernaan.~
@2   = ~Hah! Do you think I would be that bad? I can admit you became better, after all. Do you think your former master would ever acknowledge that?~
@3   = ~I do not know. Maybe not. What I know, is I no longer want to be anyone's slave.~
@4   = ~Bravo, Foundling. I am SO happy to hear that. I'll be able to see where such an intriguing path is going to take you. Hah.~
