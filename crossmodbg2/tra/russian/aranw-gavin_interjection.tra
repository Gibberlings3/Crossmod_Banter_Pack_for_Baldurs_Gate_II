@0    = ~[ARAN] Now, that be a right fine idea. You look tall eno... err... no, you be shorter than a Shortaxe. But if th' spirit be there, why not?~
@1    = ~[GAVIN] Are you mad? That's just asking for trouble.~
@2    = ~[ARAN] Boys will be boys. Might as well let 'em have it. No harm will come of it.~
@3    = ~[GAVIN] Aye, what harm could come from giving strong drink and dangerous weapons to children? I think I need to have a look at your head, Aran. You seem to have suffered a brain injury at some point.~
@4    = ~[ARAN] You remember how it goes. They'll get themselves good and drunk, ding each other once or twice, an' be pukin' in the bushes by nightfall.~
@5    = ~[GAVIN] I do remember how it goes. I also remember the axe I got in the back because Calahan's aim isn't any better drunk than it is sober.~
@6    = ~[ARAN] You lived, an' so will they. 'Sides, scars add character.~
@7    = ~[GAVIN] They'll get enough of them in time without pushing them to grow up too fast. Besides, it's <CHARNAME>'s decision, anyway.~
@8    = ~So, will you get us the swords? And the ale?~
