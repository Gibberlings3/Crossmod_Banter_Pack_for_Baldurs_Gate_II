@0 = ~So, I was wondering, Hephernaan: once <CHARNAME> doesn't need you and you don't need <CHARNAME>, what are you going to do, hmm? Scare some children? Deal with some poor man with no other options but devilish bargains?~
@1 = ~Ah, so our "fiery pet" thinks she can intimidate me? Well, no, I'm leaving some mundane ideas for the succubi. I, on the other hand, would rather focus on something greater.~
@2 = ~Perhaps making some men and women pay. Especially those that thought I would be busy forever and would think I would forget, Fade. But I do not forget easily. I hope you know that.~
@3 = ~Of course not. But that's good. Keep in mind that we all learned while helping <CHARNAME>.~
@4 = ~Oh, of course, we did! And that's good. What fun would it be otherwise? However...~
@5 = ~...please, do not make things too easy. If we are to put our experience to the test, play a little bit, then hide. That's what you do best, hmm? Hiding behind rocks and trees, like a little mouse.~
@6 = ~I can't wait for all of this to be over so I either say my deathly goodbye to you, half-demon, or you hide really good so I will never have to see your dull face again.~
