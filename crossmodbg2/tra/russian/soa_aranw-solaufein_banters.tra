@0    = ~[ARAN] So I hear you be a "good" Drow.~
@1    = ~[SOLAUFEIN] Yes, it would appear so.~
@2    = ~[ARAN] Didn't know there were any such thing.~
@3    = ~[SOLAUFEIN] I assure you, I am. I exist, and I am not alone.~
@4    = ~[ARAN] Well, I suppose you might find a rose on a dungheap, but I'd be thinkin' it would be a right easier thing to find a "good" demon servin' tea at Hareshom's o' Waterdeep.~
@5    = ~[SOLAUFEIN] Perhaps you are correct. But the followers of Eilistraee, Lady Silverhair, must be discreet if we are to guide our brothers and sisters to a lighter path.~
@6    = ~[ARAN] This Ellyartrie...~
@7    = ~[SOLAUFEIN] Eilistraee.~
@8    = ~[ARAN] Look, do there be many followers o' Her particular brand o' Drowdom?~
@9    = ~[SOLAUFEIN] Very few, I am afraid.~
@10   = ~[ARAN] Actually, that makes me a mite bit happier. I'd rather not be rethinkin' every single Drow bastard I personally put down. Chances are, none o' them be ones where I should o' hesitated.~
@11   = ~[SOLAUFEIN] Ah, my friend, for a brief moment I thought that you would see past your prejudice rather that rationalize your past actions. I will sing a prayer to Lady of the Dance for you.~
@12   = ~[ARAN] Blighted stone. Got one in my boot, I do.~
@13   = ~[SOLAUFEIN] Ah, my prejudiced fellow traveller - speech is a mirror of the soul. As a man speaks, so is he. I ask you now: who is Aran?~
@14   = ~[ARAN] I don't rightly understand th' question. Wait... mayhap I do. Do you be sayin' th' way a man speaks be a good indication o' his personality, his habits, an' so forth?~
@15   = ~[SOLAUFEIN] Why, yes. I think that is a fair assessment.~
@16   = ~[ARAN] That be a right interestin' idea. But I don't think it applies to me. You want to know me, you look at how I write, an' ignore th' language.~
@17   = ~[SOLAUFEIN] I do not think that will be a fair picture. With your scribing, you have time to think, to craft your ideas. In your speech, there is an immediacy that shows a raw truth.~
@18   = ~[ARAN] Mayhap. Or mayhap we have to agree to disagree, eh?~
@19   = ~[SOLAUFEIN] I can convince you with a simple example, if you would like.~
@20   = ~[ARAN] Aye, then, go ahead an' try.~
@21   = ~[SOLAUFEIN] Have you ever known a Drow to communicate through poetry and song?~
@22   = ~[ARAN] Point taken. An' I have to admit; mayhap I be wrong about th' only good Drow bein' a dead Drow. Mayhap there be one or two what be reasonable.~
