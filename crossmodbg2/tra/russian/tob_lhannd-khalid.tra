@0    = ~I'm glad to know that even though we both lost someone, we somehow got through it and helped <CHARNAME>.~
@1    = ~Yes, even though that wasn't exactly... easy. B-but I know what you mean. G-going through grim loss while also fighting for your l-life and that of someone else... it's m-much.~
@2    = ~On the other hand, maybe it's because of that we got through it. Maybe it's because of <CHARNAME>, because of Irenicus and Bodhi...~
@3    = ~As strange as it may sound, p-perhaps that helped. After all, we c-couldn't afford to just... stop, c-could we?~
@4    = ~Right.~
