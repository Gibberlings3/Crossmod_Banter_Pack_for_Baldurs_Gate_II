// Ajantis - Coran
@678 = ~Listen, Ajantis... it's probably not easy to follow a paladin's code of ethics when there's so much... temptation to the eye yes?~
@679 = ~I would assume You're talking about female beauty, Coran...? Yes, it excites me, but you can just admire a beautiful woman as a perfect creation of nature. With you being an elf, could you relate to that?~
@680 = ~Oh yes, I am an elf and I understand you. My kindred can spend hours contemplating what delights their eyes, whether it be a beautiful woman or a tree in bloom... but I must be some kind of unique elf, because more often than not, I want to not just admire, but... possess.~
@681 = ~And you're trying to tease me, aren't you? Well, I will answer honestly; you have to resort to self-discipline. Especially when you meet merry innkeepers or street girls who for some reason find it very amusing and tempting to seduce a paladin.~
@682 = ~But I serve the Guardian God, who teaches his followers to always be vigilant. You need to be collected and not respond to your every desire. Otherwise, you won't get far.~
@683 = ~Do you have to go somewhere far away?~
@684 = ~I follow Helm's path. It's a long journey, Coran.~
@685 = ~Good luck then. I hope that some woman will at least manage to lead you down the aisle, since other pleasures are forbidden to such strict and pious knights.~
