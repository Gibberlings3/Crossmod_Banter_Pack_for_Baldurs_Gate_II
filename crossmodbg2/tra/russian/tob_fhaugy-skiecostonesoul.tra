@0    = ~Ah... that bag is SOOO heavy!~
@1    = ~You need some help, Skie?~
@2    = ~Hmm? What? No! I mean, that's nice, but... you know I've been there. People were carrying my things all the time. I guess it's time I took care of it.~
@3    = ~Besides, I have some very delicate trinkets in there, so... I'll try to handle it myself. Even if it feels stupid, it also feels... right, I guess.~
@4    = ~Sure, I suppose it DOES make sense. Anyway, it's okay to ask for help if you need some. We can split those trinkets or something.~
@5    = ~Oh? Well... maybe? I'll make up my mind and get back to you, I guess.~
