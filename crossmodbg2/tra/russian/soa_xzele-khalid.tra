@7    = ~That's a question I can't help you with. I know very little about Harpers and... I'm not sure I'd like to know more.~
@8    = ~W-why?~
@9    = ~Because I will never be member of that group, and I don't think we have much in common. It's not like I have something against them, Khalid, but...~
