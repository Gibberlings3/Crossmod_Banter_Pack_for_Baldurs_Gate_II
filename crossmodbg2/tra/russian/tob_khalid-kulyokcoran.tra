@0 = ~There was a m-moment when I thought you'd try t-to win Queen Ellesime's heart. I... wouldn't b-be surprised if you considered that a fine challenge.~

@2 = ~That could be interesting, yes, but royalty have way too many duties, and I wouldn't want to be chained to a throne. I prefer to see many wonders, if only briefly, rather than possess one forever and let it stifle me.~
@3 = ~Well... s-sometimes I'm not sure when you're joking and when you're actually t-telling the truth.~
