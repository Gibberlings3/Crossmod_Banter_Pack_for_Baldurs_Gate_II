@0 = ~I saw that one elf in Suldanessellar. G-gods, she... looked like a younger J-Jaheira, and for a while... my heartbeat got faster.~
@1 = ~It must have felt as if you saw a ghost. A pale reflection of your past joy.~
@2 = ~I was happy, I wanted to talk to her, b-but... I know how silly it sounds. I wish it was m-my wife, but it was... someone else.~
@3 = ~I felt too embarrassed to mention that to anyone else. Especially <CHARNAME>. I talked to <PRO_HIMHER> about J-Jaheira so many times already.~
@4 = ~I don't think anyone is surprised that you're still thinking about her, Khalid. And I'm afraid it may never stop. Even after you get used to her absence, it won't be entirely gone.~
@5 = ~Hmm, I don't think acceptance m-must always be associated with instant relief or letting some of your thoughts fall into oblivion, or... anything like that. Achieving p-peace of mind doesn't require the ability t-to forget, but to face your emotions, whatever they are.~
