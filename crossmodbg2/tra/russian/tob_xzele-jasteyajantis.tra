@0    = ~I hope you learned that I mean no threat to you or <CHARNAME>, Ajantis, and to what we're trying to do.~
@1    = ~I must admit that it looks like you truly want to help. You must understand, however, where my doubts were coming from.~

@3    = ~I care about beauty, for example. And even though there are objects and people I would call beautiful and you would call abominations, I don't think it means we can't work together.~
@4    = ~Maybe. For now the goal is clear, however, we are here to help <CHARNAME> and those that need our blades.~
