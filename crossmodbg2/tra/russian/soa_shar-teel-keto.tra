@0    = ~Traveling with you, Shar-Teel, has really opened up my eyes as to what a woman can achieve if she puts her mind into it.~
@1    = ~Tell me, if I got some proper insruction from a sword master like you, do you think that one day I could make a competent fighter?~
@2    = ~Don't be silly, girl! Even with my help I doubt that you would make a worthy warrior.~
@3    = ~Perhaps I could teach you how you could have slain those kobolds in the Firewine Ruins, but beyond that, there is not much I can do.~
@4    = ~Really? Mmm.. I was hoping that you would teach me a few things.~
@5    = ~Listen well, Keto. Not everyone can be a sword master. We all have our gifts. You have yours and I have mine.~
@6    = ~But so long as you have a good bottle wine on hand for me to drink from after slaying another opponent, we should get along just fine.~
