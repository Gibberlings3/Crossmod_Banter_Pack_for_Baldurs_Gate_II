@0    = ~Is thy trothed lord of noble birth?~
@1    = ~His house stands high among the Elves of Suldanessellar, yes.~
@2    = ~Then 'twould pain him to leave the home of his fathers.  (Saerileth's voice is thoughtful, and she falls silent.)~
@3    = ~Why do you ask, Saerileth?~
@4    = ~Only for that I didst see a drow in Sigil.  Though even in the Planes drow are known and feared, 'tis not as thou dost find it on Toril.  A drow may live in peace in the City of Doors.~
@5    = ~I understand your meaning, Saerileth, and I will not forget it.~
@6    = ~It seemeth most strange to me, Yasraena, that ever thou speakest of men merely as males.  Wherefore dost thou so?~
@7    = ~It is the drow way.~
@8    = ~But there is much that thou hast forsaken of thy people and their ways.  Wherefore not this?~
@9    = ~It is not due only to the influence of the Spider Queen; thus I do not immediately hate it.  And this way is all that I have known.  It is a difficult thing to change.  What of your own people?~
@10   = ~We are a patriarchal society, and 'tis therefore even more strange to me that thou dost speak so freely of men.~
@11   = ~Is your society any better than mine then?~
@12   = ~We serve Tyr.  Thy people follow Lloth.~
@13   = ~In this, yes, I grant you.  But where we are a matriarchal society and you are patriarchal, is there any difference?~
@14   = ~Aye, for thou speakest of men as mere slaves.  The women of Everspring are treasures.~
@15   = ~And thus you, a treasured lady, have become a warrior?~
@16   = ~'Twas my father's honor to give to Tyr the greatest treasure of his house, his only daughter.~
