@1    = ~Last time you said that, you were nearly chopped in half by Gromnir's soldiers. Are you eager to repeat the experience?~ [O#XAN902]
@2    = ~Tiax dismisses these disorganized remarks as provocative! Know your place, mage!~
@3    = ~(sigh) Certainly, Tiax. I spend sleepless days and nights without food wondering where my place will be when Tiax rules. When will it be, by the - no, no, I'd prefer not to know.~
@4    = ~And rightly so! You should all dread Tiax' rule, for once he ascends, every act of discourtesy and ridicule towards Tiax the Grand will be remembered!~
@5    = ~I do not think it matters. Our inevitable demise is close, in any case.~
@6    = ~*Your* inevitable demise, for Tiax cannot die! He rules all!~
@7    = ~(groan) I can just imagine: a heap of corpses and a mad gnome, ruling it. Why do you even bother?~
@8    = ~Hmm. When Tiax rules, you will be standing on this pile, proclaiming gruesome deaths for everyone who will dare oppose Cyric and Tiax! And then you will join the pile, too.~
