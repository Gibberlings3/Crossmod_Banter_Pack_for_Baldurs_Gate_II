@3    =  ~Hmph.~
@4    = ~You're not a bad person.~
@5    =  ~Are you speaking to me again?~

@8    =  ~What could someone like you possibly tell me or lecture me about *myself*?~
@9    =  ~Go back to your woods, ranger. We are done talking.~

@17    =  ~If I did, I certainly wouldn’t share it with you.~
