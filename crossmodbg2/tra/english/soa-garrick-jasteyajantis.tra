// Ajantis - Garrick
@629 = ~The world around us is cruel and unfair, so it's always nice to meet an honest person. ~
@630 = ~Are you talking about...?~
@631 = ~About you, Garrick. You are not a knight, but you are a man of honor. It's good to have people around you who you can rely on. ~
@632 = ~Oh, I can gladly return your words to you, sir knight. You are probably glad to have returned to Athkatla, because the Order of the Radiant Heart is like home to you? ~
@633 = ~Yes, of course. I met with Sir Keldorn again... but as long as <CHARNAME> leads us in dangerous ways, fate can throw us anywhere. You have to be prepared for anything.~
