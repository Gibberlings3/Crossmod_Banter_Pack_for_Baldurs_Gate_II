@0    = ~You know, you’re nothing like your sister. She was always reading a book in some type of dark, cold corner. Although, she was kind of fun to talk too. I especially loved the look on her face when I would snatch her novels right from under her nose!~
@1    = ~You were friends with Minyae?~
@2    = ~Hmm, I am not sure if she considered me a friend but I certainly enjoyed her company.~
@3    = ~I am glad she had you then.~ 
@4    = ~I don’t think she’d say the same.~
