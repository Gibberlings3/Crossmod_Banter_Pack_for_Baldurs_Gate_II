@416 = ~I heard you were imprisoned underground.~
@417 = ~Aye, I was held prisoner in the Cloakwood Mine. It is... was the home of the Orothiar clan.~
@418 = ~So, it was essentially your home? ~
@419 = ~Aye, what are you getting at?~
@420 = ~Don't you see the irony here?~
@421 = ~You were trapped underground in your home. Dwarves love disgusting, dark, ugly tunnels!~
@422 = ~So, you should've felt at home in the prison. It was your former home after all.~
@423 = ~I don't understand this irony that you speak of.~
@424 = ~Of course, you don't, and it's not my problem.~
