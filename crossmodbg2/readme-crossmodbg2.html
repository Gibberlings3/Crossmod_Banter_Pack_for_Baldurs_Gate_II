        <p>First time installing a mod? Check out G3's comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player&rsquo;s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player&rsquo;s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
        <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
          </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the   additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the   tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program   called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
        <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
          The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note   that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the   middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if   possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able   to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole   game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay   untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install   the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in.   Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error   messages. </p>
        <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
          The Crossmod Banter Pack for Baldur's Gate II for Windows is distributed as a   self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install,   simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-crossmodbg2.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>crossmodbg2</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-crossmodbg2.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
        <p>You can run <strong>setup-crossmodbg2.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
        <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
          The Crossmod Banter Pack for Baldur's Gate II for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
        <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-crossmodbg2</strong>, <strong>setup-crossmodbg2.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>crossmodbg2</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-crossmodbg2.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
        <p>You can run <strong>setup-crossmodbg2.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
        <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
          The Crossmod Banter Pack for Baldur's Gate II for Linux is distributed as a compressed   tarball and does not   include a WeiDU installer.  Linux users will need   to do a one-time   install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
        <p>To install, run 'WeInstall crossmodbg2 in your game folder. </p>
        <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
          In addition to the methods above for removing individual   components, you can completely uninstall the mod using   setup-crossmodbg2 --uninstall at the command line to remove all   components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <p><strong>Crossmod Banter Pack for Throne of Bhaal</strong></p>
      <p> This component (1) will add new material to your install of <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> based on what mods you have installed. This component requires the previous component to be installed first.
        Note, some of these banters may also appear in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and therefore if
        they have all already played in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>, you will see no new banters in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> between those characters.</p>

      <p><strong>Version 23 - October 24, 2023</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The translation file for the SoA Minyae-Skie banters was missing, which would prevent installation if these NPCs were installed</li>
      </ul>
<p><strong>Version 22 - October 22, 2023</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug with the ToB banter between Hubelpot and Tsujatha that would stop the install</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where the ToB banter component would log messages to the SoA banter log. It was generally harmless if the SoA banters were installed, but would halt the installation if not. </li>
        <li>New SoA Content:
