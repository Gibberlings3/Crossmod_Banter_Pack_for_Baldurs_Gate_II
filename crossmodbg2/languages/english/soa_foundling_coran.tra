@0    = ~Is there any reason why you would pester all the women we encounter?~
@1    = ~Ah, so our companion, the creepy and the gloomy one, can speak! It's the first time you've actually become aware of my presence, isn't it?~
@2    = ~Well, I do believe life is too short to ignore the presence of many beautiful creatures. And I wouldn't call it "pestering", but rather giving them some admiration they do deserve.~
@3    = ~Admiration? You rather want to be a hunter. This "admiration" looks more like fishing.~
@4    = ~Fishing, you say? What I am doing is much more entertaining than any kind of fishing, gloomy one, and much more pleasant! But ah, I think I shouldn't expect someone so...secretive and black-hearted to know the tune.~
@5    = ~What tune?~
@6    = ~A very simple one - the heartbeat of a lover.~
@7    = ~I wouldn't fill my thoughts with trash I do not need.~
