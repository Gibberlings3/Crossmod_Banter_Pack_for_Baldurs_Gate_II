@0    = ~You combine many skills in your tactics, stallion. I bet many will find that impressive and want to mate with you. Skills and abilities: they say much about a person.~
@1    = ~So says someone who can turn into a centipede, but perhaps this time you are right, Faldorn. Your "skills" say much about you. And please, stop calling me a stallion and by all that is good, refrain from discussing my intimate matters.~
