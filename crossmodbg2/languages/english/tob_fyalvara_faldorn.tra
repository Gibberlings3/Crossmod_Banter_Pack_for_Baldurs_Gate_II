@2    = ~And why would I need to feel calm? No, Fyalvara, I am what you fear I am. I am rage. I am power. But I also hope for a better, nature-respecting world.~
@3    = ~I am sorry to say that, but I don't think you are.~
@4    = ~Believe what you want to believe, woman. I care little about your fear and limited understanding of the natural order.~
