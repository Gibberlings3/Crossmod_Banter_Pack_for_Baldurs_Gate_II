@5  = ~Just remember to choose the piece you want to play carefully, Wilson! Sometimes a bad scenario can seriously damage an actor's reputation and put an end to their career. In addition, the audience always throws rotten tomatoes at the performer, not the author of the piece! Each entry of an actor onto the stage is like a warrior entering the battlefield, the outcome cannot be predicted in advance.~
@6  = ~But you shouldn't have to worry, talent and wisdom are immediately visible in you, and brilliant success awaits you, I'm sure...~
@7  = ~Sorry to interrupt, Haer'Dalis. Keep on inspiring, my friend. I just thought that the experience of a master like Sir Garrick should be shared with young talents.~
