@0    = ~Well, I've seen many like you, Fhaugy, and I must say that your kind is quite easy to manipulated. Quite often, you just tell them they will get some money, food, or respect, and they will do whatever you want.~
@1    = ~You're quite into generalization, eh? I know most Twin Tusks would resist your quite transparent lies and games, Hephernaan.~
@2    = ~Well, I guess we can exclude Falvarc. He would fall for everything if you just changed into a woman he would like.~
@3    = ~Ah, that. Physical pleasures. I forgot about the oldest of ways of "motivation". I guess it would be quite effective too.~
@4    = ~Perhaps on some. To me, it's quite clear when you're trying to gain something. You use that... quite stupid tone. And if I can notice it, many of those like me would see it too.~
