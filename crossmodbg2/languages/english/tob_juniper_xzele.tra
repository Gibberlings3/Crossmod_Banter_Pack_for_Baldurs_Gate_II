@0    = ~The patchwork world of Ravenloft is familiar with all sorts of undead. But good ones are a... rare sight.~
@1    = ~I wouldn't call myself good. And neither would I call myself evil, Juniper. I am who I am, a woman that wants to matter. And to know love.~
@2    = ~Love and undeath rarely go hand in hand. I'm not saying that never happens, I've met a vampire, once, struck by a lovelorn.~
@3    = ~There are many kinds of undeath, but... I believe more of us can recognize or at least remember love, than many living may want to know. Many would rather see us as cold and unable to comprehend love or friendship or loyalty.~
@4    = ~I suppose viewing your kind that way makes things quite... easier, doesn't it?~
@5    = ~I've continued thinking about love and undeath and how most living want to see you as incapable of love or similar feelings.~
@6    = ~That made me remember that I've met people, living ones, who were also hurt so much that they were no longer to feel that kind of warmth.~
@7    = ~Mhm. Perhaps there is more than one kind of death. Sometimes it's that of a body, while other times it's that of a heart.~
@8    = ~I must admit that I'm glad I never experienced the latter one. Even if love can sometimes come hand in hand with significant pain.~
