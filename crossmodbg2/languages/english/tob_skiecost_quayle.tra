@15   = ~Hey, Quayle! Would you have thought that we would end up in places like this? You met <CHARNAME> near the city gates of Baldur's Gate, right? And now were HERE. That's far away from where the two of you met.~
@16   = ~Well, I have never ruled out that we may end up epic heroes, dealing with epic problems with my epic brains! Actually, that doesn't surprise me much, when I think of it.~
@17   = ~Well, I wonder where we'll be in a year. Maybe fighting gods or checking out new planes! I would love to see other planes and spheres!~
@18   = ~So do not rule the possibility that you'll not only see them but work there! I can certainly consider that possible!~
