@0    = ~Ha! Tiax read your notes, poor little Quayle! Ha! So you were not even able to protect your fake child! What was her name? Aerti? It doesn't matter! Now Tiax has a proof that you are really stupid!~
@1    = ~Her name is Aerie!~
@2    = ~Tiax says *was*, and that's because of your lack of power! Now she is with Cyric. ~
@3    = ~If you need proof of my lack of power, you now have it, Tiax, but know that it was a great loss for me, and you should respect that. My great mind wasn't able to protect her, but maybe one day I will find a way to bring her back to life!~
@4    = ~Both Tiax and Quayle are clerics and we both know what this is impossible now! Cyric could ressurect her, but why should he? I see that you haven't changedone eeny-tiny little bit since we met in Baldur's Gate! And Tiax will always be the *greater one*.~
@5    = ~Your words means nothing to a wise man like me! I agree that it was my mistake, but I won't be weak again. One day my mind will show you how to leave this world, Tiax!~
@6    = ~Ha! Tiax dosen't think so!~
