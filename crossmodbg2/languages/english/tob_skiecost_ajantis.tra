@33   = ~So, Ajantis, do you think I'm still so fragile and delicate? I SOMEHOW made it that far, right?~
@34   = ~As we can see, lady Skie, your bravery matches your skills, indeed.~
@35   = ~You know, you really got on my nerves when you called me fragile, Ajantis. People always looked as me as if I were some... glass figurine or something. I thought it would change after I joined the Flaming Fist, but... well, it didn't.~
@36   = ~I believe you've proven them wrong, Skie. You are a hero now.~
@37   = ~I suppose. I mean, of course I am. I'm just wondering if they will ever see me as someone else than the duke's daughter.~
@38   = ~They will, lady Skie.~
@39   = ~I hope you're right.~
