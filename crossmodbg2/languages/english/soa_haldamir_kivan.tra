@0    = ~I remember my first time going into a human settlement. I had to brace myself. I imagine you suffered quite a shock to find yourself in an unfamiliar city with no more than what you had on your back.~
@1    = ~I'm still in shock. I never imagined it could be so different!~
@2    = ~And on top of it I doubt you were allowed privacy to take your bearings. The gawkers must have followed you for I doubt any of them had seen a warrior in full attire. I hope they did not summon their precious Cowled Wizards to apprehend a stranger, the way they greeted <CHARNAME>.~
@3    = ~No, I was spared that, at least. I envy your composure.~
@4    = ~I shudder to imagine your predicament. If it may be a consolation to you, the circumstances in which the magic surge caught you could have been worse.~
@5    = ~Heh. They could. There was a mountain lion in the next cage!~
@6    = ~And you might not have had the necessary blades with you... I suppose you now might have one thing in common with the humanfolk of this city.~
@7    = ~We all hate magic.~
