@0    = ~Been wonderin'… are you always this high-strung?~
@1    = ~Tiax is not high-strung! He is perfectly relaxed and at ease among his subjects, and experiences no nervousness whatsoever, especially when he is thinking about his duties to the Great Cyric!~
@2    = ~Yeah, this is what I'm talkin' about, bunny. Like a squirrel on coffee. You like some, by the way?~
@3    = ~(sniff) Coffee? For the Great Tiax? He would like some, yes... most definitely with sugar.~
@4    = ~Here you go, then, darlin'. Your head may be screwed on wrong, but you're a damn fine companion all the same.~
@5    = ~Um... Tiax thanks you?~
@6    = ~Anytime.~
