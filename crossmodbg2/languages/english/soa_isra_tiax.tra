@0    = ~Tiax will rule all, they said! Old companions of Tiax will be quartered, they said! No one will doubt the everlasting wrath of Tiax, they said, when they took the mighty Tiax to Spellhold to take his place among the greatest wizards and priests of his time!~
@1    = ~And now what? Even some pansy-prancy paladin girl has better gear than me!~
@2    = ~<CHARNAME> has given you excellent gear, Tiax. Not that you are likely to use it for anything worthwhile.~
