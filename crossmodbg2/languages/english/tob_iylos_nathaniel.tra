@0    = ~So... an ex-member of the flaming fist. I must admit; I'm surprised to see one such as you out here, Nathaniel.~
@1    = ~I'd be surprised at myself as well, I suppose, but I travel with <CHARNAME> now. If <PRO_HESHE> needs to be here, then so do I.~
@2    = ~Dedication is a worthy trait - admirable, even. But were you not one of the ones who captured <CHARNAME> <PRO_HIMHERSELF>, and accused them of crimes against Baldur's Gate? Surely you cannot have faith in one such as <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@3    = ~I wasn't there when those things happened, but I saw what Angelo did to the Fist. He was corrupt and <CHARNAME> stopped him, as well as a war that would have killed thousands!~
@4    = ~Those accusations were false, and I wasn't even present at the time -- <CHARNAME> is worthy of my trust and <PRO_HESHE> should be worthy of yours, too.~
@5    = ~Perhaps. But perhaps not. Such devotion does not come without cause.~
@6    = ~Hmph. We shall see. Such devotion does not come without cause, I suppose.~
