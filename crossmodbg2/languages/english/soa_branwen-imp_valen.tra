@0    = ~Nothing good will come from traveling with an evil creature such as you, Valen. May the Shield of Tempus protect us from your wicked ways.~
@1    = ~What is your problem with me, Branwen? Am I not a dedicated servant and member of my family?~
@2    = ~A family of dark creatures that feed on the blood of others.~
@3    = ~Does not the horned owl prey upon the field mouse after dark?~
@4    = ~That has nothing to do with this.~
@5    = ~Oh? I think it does. Survival.. we are all bound to it. Are vampires not allowed to fight for their place in the chain of life?~
@6    = ~Vampires unbalance that chain! Distort it.. until nothing is left but overlords and cattle and notions such as freedom and liberty would be lost relics of a forgotten age.~
@7    = ~Think as you like, Branwen. We have been here for thousands of years and will be here for thousands more.~
