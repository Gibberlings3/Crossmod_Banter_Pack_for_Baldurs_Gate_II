@0    = ~Never in a million years could I ever imagine that I would be traveling with a rakshasa.~
@1    =  ~Here we go again, another elf to show her discontent at my presence. I wonder, what makes you more uneasy - that I am the one that must defend your back during our battles or that I am nearby while you sleep?~
@2    =  ~I don't sleep. I simply stay in reverie.~
@3    =  ~So it is the latter then.~
@4    =  ~I never stated that I was scared of you.~
@5    =  ~And I never said that you were scared of me either, merely discontent with my company. However, now that we know the secret that makes you wet the bed --~
@6    =  ~I don't have any secrets, cat. Stop making this up!~
@7    =  ~Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. *grin*~
@8    = ~You are strange for an elf.~
@9    =  ~What an astute observation. Would you like some catnip or perhaps a rodent to chase around as a reward?~
@10    =  ~Hah! You've got a tongue for someone so skinny and frail. It's a wonder how you are able to pick up and swing and injure any opponent with your daggers.~
@11    =  ~You out of all people should know that it is not strength that always matters, it is where you hit.~
@12    =  ~Ah, you may be correct there but it doesn't hurt to have some upper body strength, yes?~
@13    =  ~I suggest you keep up with more physically taxing training as much as you stick your nose in those books.~
@14    = ~How does it feel to be a babysitter, Verr'Sza?~
@15    =  ~Or should I say cub-sitter?~
@16    =  ~I would have thought you would be able to come up with something more clever than the regular feline jokes I constantly hear.~
@17    =  ~It's not whether I am clever or not; it's simply because the opportunity presented itself so I might as well take it. Surely you must understand.~
@18    =  ~Your attempts to jab at me and my kin are mediocre at best. So no, I don't comprehend your "opportunities".~
@19    =  ~Cats aren't known for their intellect anyway, so that is completely understandable.~
@20    = ~I was half expecting you to be a kitten I could carry in my pack. Such a disappointment.~
@21    =  ~But I can see the ferocity and fascination in your eyes when we are in battle, so maybe that excitement can be replicated if I throw a ball of twine at your general direction.~
@22    =  ~The intensity of a battle and a ball of twine are two very different things, Minyae.~
@23    =  ~Don't you ever feel the rhythm of a fight coursing through your veins? Or maybe your senses are heightened because the next moment is beyond your prediction?~
@24    =  ~Do not lecture me like I am a child. I know full well the difference between the two.~
@25    =  ~Then don't speak to me as such.~
