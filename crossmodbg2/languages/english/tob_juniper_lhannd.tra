@0    = ~That mustache: I know at least two Vistani men who would be quite jealous of it.~
@1    = ~Well, I'm not surprised. Not everyone can grow such a piece of wonder on their own.~
@2    = ~One of my friends, Blatnik, always wanted to be this... manly man, with a proper beard and, most likely, a mustache like yours, but I suppose nature always expected him to wear a different face. One with less hair.~
@3    = ~Ah, that can be quite difficult for some men. Realizing that they won't be able to wear something like that.~
@4    = ~Luckily, he still was quite popular among many women. He's always been quite handsome, even without a beard. And not every woman enjoys being tickled when kissed.~
@5    = ~Hah! That is true! Actually, I know one that broke up with me. Well, partially because of my mustache, but also because I can be quite stubborn.~
@6    = ~Right. Well, I guess you weren't meant for each other.~
@7    = ~Yes, I suppose. And Who would I be without my signature mustache, hmm?~
