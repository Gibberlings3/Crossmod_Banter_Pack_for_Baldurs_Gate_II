@0    = ~A fellow rogue with an adventuring spirit! And the sweetest Hanali Celanil is sending me a bright-clear vision: I see two kegs of the finest ale in the Five Flagons for us in the future. I can just bet I'll empty mine faster.~
@1    = ~Ha! I've been appreciatin' good brew on the farm while you were still prancin' along the forests of Cormanthor, Corry, or wherever you were prancin'. You're on!~
@2    = ~Corry, hmm? And the wager will be?..~
@3    = ~O-ho! So it's after my body you're lustin', darlin'?~
@4    = ~You wound me, Dace. Your body alone? What about your soul, this brash but generous heart, your quick wit, or down-to-earth practical thinking? Not to mention these thighs...~
@5    = ~Which fall into 'don't touch what you haven't won' category, so hands off, Corry! For now, at least. We'll see how you perform with that keg.~
@6    = ~And I am beginning to like her. Oh, who am I kidding? I am totally smitten. <CHARNAME>, forget your Irenicus! Let's find a wizard and teleport to the Five Flagons right now!~
