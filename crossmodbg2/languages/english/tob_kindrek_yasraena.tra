@0    = ~Yasraena!  I have failed to take you into my bed, but let me enlighten you on the wonders of slaughtering wizards!~
@1    = ~My Divalir is a wizard.~
@2    = ~Yes, I know!  And it takes everything within me to keep from marching off right now to hack him into tiny pieces!~
@3    = ~(Yasraena's swords fly out.)  If I thought you stood a chance against him, I would slay you right now for that threat.  But he is as fine a warrior as a wizard.~
@4    = ~Be that as it may, he has grown weak in his dependence on magic!  One swing of Disruptor and the game is up.~
@5    = ~When his spell protections fled from him, he would cower like a weeping babe at my boots, and there I would crush his skull under my heel!~
@6    = ~(Yasraena masters her quickly-growing anger.)  Kindrek, I pity you.~
@7    = ~Pity?  Bah!~
@8    = ~You kill, and you kill, and you kill, and there is nothing for you. I do not fear for Divalir, for he has those who love him to protect him.~
@9    = ~But when your enemies come for you, or when you are foolish enough to seek out foes beyond your strength, who will come to your aid?~
@10   = ~I need no-one.  Disruptor is my constant companion.~
@11   = ~Cold company.~
