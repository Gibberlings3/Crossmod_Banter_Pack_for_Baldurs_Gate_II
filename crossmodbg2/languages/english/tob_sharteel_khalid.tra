@0    = ~You still haven't learned how to fight properly, half-elf. I had to kill those things that tried to push you back in the last fight. You owe me.~
@1    = ~I'm grateful for t-that, Shar-Teel. I do my b-best, but that's why we work together, no? B-because we need to look out for each other, even if we rarely agree on everyday m-matters.~
@2    = ~You make a lot of mistakes in battle, and you clearly hold yourself back! It makes me wonder what that druid-wife of yours saw in you. I can't believe that you are still alive and she is not.~
@3    = ~I asked m-myself that question more than once, Shar-Teel, but it's never been yours to ask. Take m-my advice and b-be... quiet for once.~
@4    = ~Oh, look! You're finally NOT holding yourself back. That's good to see. But let's go, half-elf. We still have a lot to do. Make yourself useful and kill something or someone during our next battle.~
