@0    = ~I have one more question about love.~
@1    = ~Yes? What is it?~
@2    = ~You can't have children with other men.~
@3    = ~Oh, I think I know what you're thinking about.~
@4    = ~It's not always about children. One man can love another just like that. It's not always about children. It's about support.~
@5    = ~But this group is supporting you, as I understand it.~
@6    = ~Yes, but I think love is a different kind of support. Support and belief.~
@7    = ~Hmm... it may be indeed difficult to understand. Thank you, though.~
