@41 = ~Gavin, your skill in drawing fascinates me. I have seen a lot of books from the surface in my life, and several with drawings in them. It was... a way to see the surface world with your eyes, so to say - and without risking my life. I wondered, though - did you also draw while being in the Underdark?~
@42 = ~I'm a bit surprised to hear you phrase this question here and now - although I thank you for your interest, of course.~
@43 = ~I admit I picked an idle question on purpose, one that is not related to the things happening to us currently... I apologize if it is not to your liking to be derailed from our current tasks.~
@44 = ~On the contrary, I am thrilled to be derailed from all the craziness happening around us. I only drew very little down there - and not only because the light is so bad. I didn't really feel like drawing while walking in the shoes of a drow.~
@45 = ~(snort!) Yes, I can imagine.~
@46 = ~Nevertheless, I very much wouldn't mind showing you what I have at our next rest. Maybe you can help me identify some of the phosphorescent fungi.~
