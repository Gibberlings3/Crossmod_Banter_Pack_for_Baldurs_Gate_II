@0    = ~I'd love to see the faces of the Baldur's Gate nobles watching you get into the palace. You see, they can be really... prim.~
@1    = ~Well, I'm unsure if they would let me in, huh. But, some would certainly see me as a sort of a... party-killer.~
@2    = ~They would let you in if I were by your side, perhaps. I guess. And I would certainly give it a try, even if only to see their faces.~
@3    = ~But, it doesn't look like we'll be moving back north, to Baldur's Gate, so... I guess we won't find out. Not anytime soon, at least.~
@4    = ~I suppose we can still confuse those from Athkatla or Imnesvale. That's still something!~
@5    = ~I suppose it would be quite interesting to spar with you, Fhaugy, but on the other hand, I'm a bit afraid of getting... smashed. Heh. Especially if that would be a no-weapons-or-magic-allowed kind of sparring.~
@6    = ~Well, we can still give it a try! I promise I won't make you feel little, haha!~
@7    = ~Oh, you would need to stay at a distance and throw sticks at me. THEN, I wouldn't feel little.~
@8    = ~Most people may feel little just by standing next to you, my friend.~
