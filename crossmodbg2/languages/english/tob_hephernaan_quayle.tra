@1 = ~Pff! You may insult me, Hephernaan, but you won't provoke me to do things I do not want to do. I will stay. Help <CHARNAME>. I want this and... well, I think Aerie would want that too if she knew our leader.~
@2 = ~Ah, of course. I should have known you would immortalize that girl in your fantasies.~
@3 = ~I... I am aware that she passed, but it doesn't mean I shouldn't be Quayle she would love to see. Quayle she would like.~
@4 = ~Of course. Do as you please. Who am I to tell you that you made this fantasy because otherwise, your world would shatter. Only a cruel person would say that, no?~
