@0    = ~I usually do not mind fighting along fierce beasts, but a devil... that is much different. You are a threat. Your feet harm nature with each one of your steps!~
@1    = ~Oh, really? Say sorry to her from me. Or don't.~
@2    = ~Insolent thing...~
@3    = ~Call me insolent or call me a threat. I care very little about any words from a savage thing like yourself.~
@4    = ~I would gladly try if my claws and teeth would be strong enough to pierce through your devilish skin. I would no longer need to wonder if your blood tastes of iron, like that of other humanoids and animals.~
@5    = ~You wish I was like your kind, but I am so much more than that, Faldorn. But, I can pretend, if that's going to make you feel better.~
@6    = ~On the other hand, why should I make you feel better? I would rather see you drown in misery, savage thing.~
@7    = ~You like to play with the minds of others, but your mockery won't work on me.~
@8    = ~That mockery, Faldorn, is just for my own pleasure.~
