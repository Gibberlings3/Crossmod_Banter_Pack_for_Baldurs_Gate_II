@0    = ~You remind me of a friend I once had, Eddard. He lived in Silverymoon. But... it's been years ago.~
@1    = ~It must be difficult. To remember everything, your previous life... and knowing that there is no way back to it.~
@2    = ~I had to accept it; I have Evening Glory and my new purpose. I just hope that my friend is still alive and... prosperous. He always wanted to have that kind of life.~
@3    = ~Still, you must miss him.~
@4    = ~Well... perhaps I do.~
@5    = ~It's quite clear you were taught the art of tactics and motivation, Eddard. I assume your parents insisted on such lessons?~
@6    = ~Well, sometimes it feels like my whole family is expected to lead by example: inspire and protect.~
@7    = ~I see. I suppose much is expected from Silvershields, then. These are not easy tasks.~
@8    = ~I guess they're not...~
